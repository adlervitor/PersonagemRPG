# rpgcharcreation
A program that allows players to create character sheets for a post-apocalyptic zombie survival role-playing game (RPG). 

Create Unique Characters: The program lets players create their own unique characters, complete with names, backgrounds, and two chosen abilities.
Character Attributes: Characters have various attributes such as Hit Points (HP), Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Charisma, determined by rolling 10-sided dice.
Equipment and Items: Players can equip their characters with weapons, items, and a special lantern to aid them on their journey.
Randomization: Weapon attributes are generated by rolling 6-sided dice, adding an element of randomness and uniqueness to each character.
Background-Based Item: Each character gets to choose a personalized item based on their background, enhancing role-playing possibilities.
Character Management: The program allows users to add and remove equipment and items from their characters' inventories, providing flexibility in character development.
Examine Character Sheets: Players can view and manage character sheets, displaying all the details of their created characters.

This project was created as a learning exercise for C++. The project demonstrates various fundamental aspects of C++ programming, such as handling user input, 
using classes and objects, working with vectors and strings.
